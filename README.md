# Linux Text Editors Project

This project demonstrates how I explored and practiced using two popular Linux text editors: **Vim** and **Nano**. The goal was to learn how to create, edit, save, and navigate text files using both editors from the command line.

---

## Tools Used
- Terminal on a Linux-based system
- Vim Editor
- Nano Editor

---

##  Working With Vim Editor

### Step 1: Creating and Opening a File
To begin, I created a new text file called `exercise.txt` and opened it using Vim with the command:
```
vim exercise.txt
```

### Step 2: Entering Insert Mode
Once Vim opened, I pressed the `i` key to enter **Insert Mode**, which allows typing text into the file.

### Step 3: Typing Text into the File
In Insert Mode, I typed the following:
```
Hello, this is a Vim hands-on project.
Welcome to darey.io.
```

### Step 4: Saving and Exiting Vim
To save and quit Vim:
- I pressed `Esc` to return to Normal Mode.
- Then I typed `:wq` and pressed `Enter`.

### Additional Vim Practice
- **Navigation:** Used arrow keys and `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` to move around.
- **Delete a Character:** Pressed `x` in Normal Mode.
- **Delete a Line:** Pressed `dd` to delete an entire line.
- **Undo a Change:** Pressed `u` to undo the last change.
- **Quit Without Saving:** Pressed `Esc`, then typed `:q!` and pressed `Enter`.

## ðŸ“ Working With Nano Editor

### Step 1: Creating and Opening a File
I created a new file named `nano_file.txt` using Nano:
```
nano project_file.txt
```

### Step 2: Typing Into the File
Once inside the Nano editor, I started typing immediately:
```
This is my first Nano text file.
Nano is simple and easy to use.
```

### Step 3: Saving and Exiting Nano
To save and quit Nano:
- I pressed `Ctrl + O` to write (save) the file and confirmed with `Enter`.
- Then I pressed `Ctrl + X` to exit the editor.

### Opening an Existing File
To open a previously created file:
```bash
nano nano project_file.txt
```
- I added more few line
- save with ctrt + o
- exist with ctr + x

## What I Learned
- How to create and open files using Vim and Nano.
- How to navigate, edit, and save content in both editors.
- Basic command-line editing workflows using text-based tools in Linux.

This hands-on project gave me confidence in using Linux terminal editors effectively, which is essential for scripting and system configuration tasks.
